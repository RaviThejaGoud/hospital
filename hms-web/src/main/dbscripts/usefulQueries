
1. For providing multi branch option we need to do following steps.
------------------------------------------------------------------


Step 1:- 
              insert record into masterCustomer table.
              ex:- insert into masterCustomer (id,version,contactNumber,custEmail,organization,status) values(1,0,8025440141,'admin@eazyschol.in','Upper Room Schools','Y');

Step 2:-
          Update customer table of masterCustId column using this masterCustId value. Suppose if SVMS(custId=2) and SVGHSS(custId=15) are two customers if these two school are belonging to same school. We need to update masterCustId column of these two customers.
         ex :- update customer set masterCustId=1 where id in(2,15);
 
Step 3 :-
         Then insert records into UserBranches table. Based on these values user can access multiple customers.
           ex :- insert into UserBranches(2,2);
                  insert into UserBranches values (2,15);

           Here first value is the userId, second value is the customerId. So UserId 2 can access customerId 2 and 15 data. 
------------------------------------------------------------
2. Fee Payments Update/Delete

Please find below steps to delete student payments for particular customer


1) Soft/hard delete the records in below tables

Soft:
update studentFeePaidDetails set deleteStatus='Y', deleteDescription='As per customer Requested' where custId=204;
update studentPayment set deleteStatus='Y' , deleteDescription='As per customer Requested' where custId=204;

2) update the feePaidStatus column to 'N'

update student set feePaidStatus ='N'  where custId=204;

3) If we want to set the invoice number from 1, run the below query

update studentPayment set invoiceNumber=0 where custId=204;


4) To get max invoice number. 
select max(invoiceNumber) from studentPayment where custId=204;
--------------------------------------------------------
