								shared, and takes your privacy seriously. You acknowledge that
								you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy
								Policy. By using the Services, you are consenting to have your
								personal data transferred to and processed in India.
							</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Product collects and uses
								information from its users who access or use the Services,
								including Product's treatment of personally identifiable
								information ("Personal Information"). Also, this Services,
								including Product's treatment of personally Privacy Policy
								covers Product's treatment of any Personal Information that
								Product's business partners share with Product, or that you
								provide to the Product through a third party website or service
								using a Product application. This policy does not apply to
								websites or services or practices of companies that Product does
								not own or control, or to individuals that Product does not
								employ or manage.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>WHAT INFORMATION DOES PRODUCT DISPLAY OR COLLECT?</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>When you use the Services, you may set up your personal
								profile, send messages, perform searches and queries, and
								transmit information through various channels as permitted by
								the functionality of the Services. The information we gather
								from users enables us to personalize and improve our services,
								and, in some cases, to allow our users to set up a user account
								and profile through the Services. In most cases, we retain such
								information to provide the Services to you and our other users
								and to provide a useful user experience. When you update
								information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version
								for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior
								version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we
								collect the following types of information from our users.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US:</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>We receive and store any information you knowingly enter
								on the Services, whether via computer, mobile phone, other
								wireless device, or that you provide to us in any other way.
								This information may include Personal Information such as your
								name, phone number, email address, photograph, and, in certain
								circumstances, your school affiliation, which is used to provide
								notifications to users via the Services from a teacher, school,
								and/or district ("Notifications"), and any other information
								necessary for us to provide our services. We only collect a
								child's name, email address, and that child's parent's email
								address. You may choose not to provide us with certain
								information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of
								many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is
								used for such purposes as providing the Services, responding to
								your requests for certain information, products and services,
								customizing the content you see, and communicating with you
								about specials and new features. You may modify or remove your
								Personal Information identified below at any time by logging
								into your account and accessing features to edit your classes
								and/or account information.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY:</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever
								you interact with the Services or our services. Product
								automatically receives and records information on our server
								logs from your browser including your IP address, Product cookie
								information, and the page you requested. We also record the
								details of your activity on the Services. This information is
								not Personal Information. Certain information that is collected
								automatically such as device ID and phone number will be treated
								as Personal Information.</p>
							<p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage
								information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to
								our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate
								how many people watched a particular show. Product only uses
								this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure,
								and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This
								type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users
								use parts of the Services or services so that we can make the
								Services appealing to as many users as possible, and improve
								those services. As part of this use of information, we may
								provide aggregate information to our partners about how our
								users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of
								statistical data so that our partners also understand how often
								people use our partners' services and the Services to help
								provide you with an optimal online experience.</p>
							<p>
								<strong>Mobile Application:</strong> When users download and use
								our mobile application, we automatically device ID, device type,
								user agent browser, what OS they are running, whether or not you
								signed up on the web, and phone number.
							</p>
							<p>We collect Student images and Staff images while the Class
								Teacher/Admin took images from their mobile and we will show
								those images in web application for our core features like
								Profile image, Scorecard generation and ID card generation
								purpose.</p>
							<p>
								We collect geo-location information from teachers when they
								download and use our mobile application. The purpose for doing
								so is to provide teachers a generic phone number in their area
								code so that we are able to provide them with one in their area.
								If the teachers no longer wish to have their location
								information collected or used they may turn these features off
								within the settings of their phone or contact us at <a
									href="mailto:support@eazyschool.com"><u>support@eazyschool.com</u></a>.
								We do not ask you for, access or automatically track any
								location-based information from students' or parents' mobile
								devices at any time.
							</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>EMAIL AND TEXT MESSAGE COMMUNICATIONS:</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>
								If you provide us your email address or phone number, we may
								send you email or text message communications. By maintaining a
								Product account and/or failing to opt out of the receipt of
								information hereunder, you acknowledge that you may receive
								e-mail or text messages on your phone or mobile communications
								device, and that the receipt of such messages may cause you to
								incur usage charges or other fees or costs in accordance with
								your wireless or data service plan. Any and all such charges,
								fees, or costs are your sole responsibility. You should consult
								with your wireless carrier to determine what rates, charges,
								fees, or costs may apply. We may receive a confirmation when you
								open an email from Product if your computer supports this type
								of program. Product uses this confirmation to help us make
								emails more interesting and helpful. If you no longer wish to
								receive these types of communications you may opt-out by
								following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each
								communication or by emailing us at <a
									href="mailto:support@eazyschool.com"><u>support@eazyschool.com</u></a>.
							</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>PUSH NOTIFICATIONS</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>
								We send push notifications to users who are students when their
								teacher has posted something new within the class to which they
								belong. If you no longer with to receive such communications,
								you may turn them off at the device level. Any user may email us
								at <a href="mailto:support@eazyschool.com"><u>support@eazyschool.com</u></a>
								if such user no longer wishes to receive communications from the
								Services.
							</p>
							<p></p>

								your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our
								systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages
								in our site are visited and by how many people. Product cookies
								do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the
								general information collected through cookies with other
								Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen
								name or email address is.</p>
							<p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie
								feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new
								cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your
								browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each
								new cookie in a variety of ways. We highly recommend that you
								leave the cookies activated, however, because you will not be
								able to log in or use many of the Services' most attractive
								features without cookies enabled.</p>

								privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these
								cookies.</p>
							<p></p>

							<p></p>
							<p>Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which
								allows you to signal to operators of websites and web
								applications and services (including behavioral advertising
								services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain
								of your online activities over time and across different
								websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at
								this time, which means that we collect information about your
								online activity both while you are using the Services and after
								you leave our Services.</p>
							<p></p>
							<h3>MOBILE ANALYTICS</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better
								understand the functionality and performance of our Mobile
								Software on your phone. This software may record information
								such as how often you use the application, the events that occur
								within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and
								where the application was downloaded from.</p>
